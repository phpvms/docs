title: Getting Help
---

This guide details the requirements for getting help with phpVMS or vmsACARS.

## How to ask for help

:::info Before asking for help, try to reproduce on the
[demo site](https://demo.phpvms.net), and with the `default` skin :::

Without a lot of this information, it will be difficult to provide help.

## Where to get help

### Forums

The forums are located at [https://forum.phpvms.net](https://forum.phpvms.net).
Search in the forums and on Github first for your issue before asking. For 3rd
party addons, be sure to post in your own

### Discord

There's also a Discord channel for quick questions.
[Invite Code Here](https://discord.gg/wvAmMnd)

### Github

The bug tracker is located on
[Github](https://github.com/nabeelio/phpvms/issues). To post an issue, you need
a Github account, and then select "New Issue". After that, select "Bug Report".
There is a small template there that you can use, but try to include as much of
the information below:

---

## Information Required

- A clear description of the issue
  - What page stuff happened on
  - Relevent data
- Versions
  - **PHP Version**
  - **Database versions** - MySQL, MariaDB or Percona, or whatever other backend
    your running
  - **phpVMS Version**
    - From either the admin panel (bottom left, click on the version for the
      full version)
    - Running `php artisan phpvms:version` ![](img/version.png)
- How to reproduce the error
  - Include as much detail as possible
  - Include any relevent data - for example, an error with expenses, include how
    the expenses are configured. See "Exporting Data" below.
- Screenshots
- Type of hosting - shared, VPS, dedicated, etc

### Logs

- **Laravel logs**: These are located in `storage/logs`, you must include these.
  Look through the logs to also ensure that no sensitive information is included
  inadvertantly
- **PHP logs**: These can be found wherever your PHP error logs are kept, for
  example, the PHP-FPM logs. Ask your host, if you don't know. They're often
  found in cPanel, under Error Logs.
- **HTTP logs**: These are, for example, your Apache logs. These might be
  required, depending on the issue. If you're not sure how to get them, ask your
  host. They're often found in cPanel, under Error Logs.
- Exported data data - see below
- Any and all other relevent details

---

## Enable Debug and Debugging

- Look at the logs - they're located in `storage/logs`
- Enable debug logging and the Laravel Debug Toolbar, open your `.env`
  - `APP_DEBUG` to `true`
  - `DEBUG_TOOLBAR` to `true` (if you want the debug toolbar)

#### Exporting Data for Troubleshooting

Sometimes, additional data for troubleshooting is required. To export that data
more easily, you can use the artisan YAML exporter, listing the tables to
export:

```bash
cd /path/to/phpvms
php artisan phpvms:yaml-exporter table1 table2
```

---

## vmsACARS

Before asking for help, make sure to:

- Rescan your scenery (Required for FS9, FSX, P3D and X-Plane)
- If crashing, delete the `data` folder, and restart
- If using MSFS (2020 and/or 2024) be sure your `fsuipc-lvar-module` is up to
  date (Also known as FsUipc WASM Module)

When asking for help:

- Log files (zipping and sending the whole folder is best);
  - For v1: these are in the `logs` folder of your vmsAcars install directory
  - For v2: these are in the `Documents\vmsacars\logs` folder
- Other relevant files, e.g, flight plans
- System setup:
  - Sim you're using
  - Any flight sim hardware running/additional software (some of this has been
    seen to interfere)
