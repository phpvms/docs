The installation requires a few steps:

1. File Permissions - some folders are written into and their permissions need
   to be configured properly
1. Database Setup - right now, only MySQL (or its offshoots, like MariaDB or
   Percona are supported). Create the credentials for the database using either
   the command line or the cPanel Database Wizard.
1. Composer Install - only if you have cloned it from git or downloaded the
   "raw" zip/tar and not a release or distributed version
1. Running the installer - This is a web interface, through which you can also
   import your older phpVMS 2.x or 5.x install

---

## 1. File Permissions

Adjust your file permissions to have the proper owner, but also read/write
permissions (`775`) for:

- `bootstrap`
- `bootstrap/cache`
- `storage/logs`
- `storage/framework/cache`
- `storage/framework/session`
- `storage/framework/views`

---

## 2. Database Setup

Before running the install, you need to configure the database with the database
itself and the credentials. Refer to your hosts documentation for specifics -
the database name, username and password here are just examples, replace them
with your own. This example is for MySQL:

:::caution Character Set and Collation If you're using a non-English language,
make sure that you're setting the `CHARACTER SET` and `COLLATE` properly (see
below for the utf8 values). By default it's `latin` which would result in
corrupted characters :::

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `phpvms` CHARACTER SET UTF8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'phpvms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON phpvms.* TO 'phpvms'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Using the cPanel Database Wizard

You can also use the cPanel Wizard to create the credentials prior to install

## 3. Composer Install

:::info If you've downloaded a release or dev tar/zip from the downloads
section, you don't need this. You only need this if you've cloned the repository
:::

Update the composer dependencies; this will download and update the `vendor`
folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/phpvms
composer install
```

---

## 4. Running the Installer

:::info There isn't a `setup` folder in the tar file. It's done as a Laravel
route, which serves to see that your webserver/htaccess files are working
correctly. :::

Once you go to your site, you'll see a page like this, click to proceed to the
installer.

After clicking next, you'll see the requirements check page. The installer will
only let you proceeed if all of the requirements are met.

The next page brings you to the database setup page. Select `MySQL` (`sqlite`
requires some extra configuration)

- Enter the name of your site and the URL
- Enter your database credentials.
  - These are the credentials created above
  - Contact your host for the correct database server address. Usually it is
    `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` but it might be different
  - You can test to make sure they're working by clicking the "Test Database
    Credentials" button

After clicking "Setup Database", you'll see the installation screen. Hit next to
proceed:
