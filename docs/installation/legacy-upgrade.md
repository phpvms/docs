You can import through either the installer or the command line after install.

## Installer

After completing the database configuration step, you'll be given the option to
import

## Command Line

The importer tool can also be run on the command line, via a PHP artisan
command. Before running the importer, you should install phpVMS using the
installer. Both the `config.php` and `.env` files will need to exist.

:::caution This will erase all of your current data. If you've already
installed, the importer plugin is disabled, and must be first enabled with
`php artisan module:enable Importer` :::

```bash
cd /path/to/phpvms
php artisan phpvms:importer  {db_host} {db_name} {db_user} {db_pass?}
```

Where

- `db_host` - The database host where your legacy phpVMS install is
- `db_name` - The database username for your legacy phpVMS install
- `db_pass` - Database password for your legacy phpVMS install.

Example:

```bash
php artisan phpvms:importer "localhost" "phpvms_legacy" "php_legacy_username" "phpvms_legacy_password"
```

### Notes and caveats

Due to some changes with how some of the fundamentals have changed within the
system, be aware of the following:

- Users will have to reset their passwords by using the 'forgot password' option
  on the sign-in page
- Column names don't entirely match up between the databases
- IDs will differ (numeric, or PIREP IDs will be converted to the new
  alphanumeric format)
- To ensure a correct import of finances, PIREPs must either be accepted or
  rejected in version 5 before launching the import, but they should not be left
  pending.

#### Post Import Notes

- Aircraft that are imported are all placed in a generic subfleet. You will need
  to go and either add additional subfleets, or just rename this subfleet to
  whatever you want
- All flights will be assigned to this subfleet. Unfortunately, you will need to
  re-assign the flights to be with the proper subfleet
- Ranks are now assigned subfleets they are allowed to fly. This is different
  from the old version, which operated on a linear progression for the aircraft
  that are allowable per-rank. You will need to edit the ranks and set the
  subfleets that are assigned to them.
