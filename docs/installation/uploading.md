title: Uploading Files
---

When uploading the files, you have several options on how to. These mainly apply
to shared hosts. For your own server or if you have control over the vhost
files, upload/extract the files to your desired location and point the vhost to
the `/public` folder.

:::tip If you are uploading to a shared host or to cPanel, chose one of the
following methods when uploading your files. :::

---

## Option 1: Creating a Subdomain

:::tip Creating a subdomain is the easiest and more recommended method,
especially for shared hosting. This works well if you have a landing or promo
page on your site's main domain, and then a subdomain like `crew.yourva.com` or
something similar. :::

Upload phpVMS to a directory with the name of your subdomain, for example,
`demo.vmshost.io`. It should be parallel to the `public_html` folder (as above).
In this example, I want to create the subdomain `demo.vmshost.io`.

First, create a folder to extract phpVMS into:

```
/home/youruser
  demo.vmshost.io < Extract phpvms files into here
  public_ftp
  public_html
```

Next, extract the phpvms files into this folder, so it looks something like:

```
/home/youruser
  /demo.vmshost.io
    /app
    /config
    /public
    ...
```

Next, create a subdomain cPanel, go to "Subdomains", and create the subdomain.
For the "Document Root", enter the path above, with the public folder -
`demo.vmshost.io/public`. Usually, cPanel will autocomplete the path to be the
subdomain - so just add `/public` to the end of it.

It will look like this:

## Option 2: Copying the public directory

:::tip Uploading and change the path of the public directory is the recommended
method if you're on shared hosting :::

This method works well if your main site is going to be phpVMS.

1. Download/upload phpVMS into a `phpvms` folder in your home folder. It should
   look something like:
2. Copy the files from the `/public` folder into the `public_html` folder.

```
/home/youruser
    phpvms      < Create this folder and upload phpvms into it
    public_ftp
    public_html < Upload the files from phpvms/public into
```

As long as you named the folder `phpvms`, the `index.php` will autodetect the
location of the phpVMS folder.

:::note Updates/auto-updates won't update the files in the `/public_html`
folder, you'll need to update them manually. The other method, the symlink
method, is recommended if you have command-line access and are more comfortable
creating those types of links. :::

---

## Option 3: Symlink

:::caution This is an advanced method and not recommended to use on shared
hosts, only do this if you know what you're doing :::

This method works well if your main site is going to be phpVMS, and you're not
running something like Wordpress. Running phpVMS in a subdirectory isn't
recommended (see method 2 instead).

Download/upload phpVMS into a `phpvms` folder in your home folder. It should
look something like:

```
/home/youruser
    phpvms
    public_ftp
    public_html
```

To make this work properly and be secure, we're going to change the
`public_html` directory to point into the phpVMS public directory. Then you can
upload files as usual, but phpVMS will be the primary entry point. When you
create folder/files in the `public_html` directory, they'll actually get created
into the `phpvms/public` folder.

SSH into your server, symlink the `public_html` folder to point to
`phpvms/public` instead:

```bash
mv public_html public_html_backup
ln -s phpvms/public/ public_html
```

---

## Option 4: Direct Upload (Not Recommended!)

:::warning This method isn't recommended, it could expose some sensitive
directories if it isn't setup correctly. :::

This method isn't recommended because it can potentially expose your install if
the `.htaccess` or something isn't correctly configured. Upload the files
directly into the `public_html` folder, and make sure the `.htaccess` file is
active (check with your webhost). This uses the `public` folder directly.
