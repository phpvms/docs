1. Make a backup of your site! Skip this at your own peril. At a minimum, make a backup of the `env.php` files. Also, make note of any changes you made to files in the `/config` folder - I recommend making a backup of this as well and checking to see if there are changes to any of those files which might need to be copied over.
1. On your remote site, delete the `vendor` folder
1. On your remote site, delete all of the files in `bootstrap/cache` and `storage/framework/cache` (delete the contents, NOT the folders)
1. Upload all of the files, and overwrite everything. If you are using `composer`, then run a `composer install`
1. Visit the `/update` URL of your site (e,g `http://myva.com/update`) to complete the update/installs
1. Check the changelog for template changes so you can update your skin
