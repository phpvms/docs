## Installer 404

If you're getting a 404 when trying to access the installer, this is either
because:

1. You haven't uploaded the files properly -
   [read Uploading Files](/installation/uploading)
1. Your vhost isn't correct - [read VHost Configuration](/installation/vhost)
1. Your host doesn't support `.htaccess` files - contact your host

## Permissions Errors

The installer will present a list of folders which need to have write access by
your webserver user. Contact your host if you're having problems with this.
