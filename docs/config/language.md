# Change phpVMS Language

It is possible to change the system language from one of the available
languages.

To do this, consult the directory `phpvms/resources/lang/` to see the name of
the available ones.

Example: We want portuguese from brazil, We check that it is there
`phpvms/resources/lang/pt-br`

Edit the `.env` file with your desire language name, pt-br in our example.

## `APP_LOCALE=pt-br`
