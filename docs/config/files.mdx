## Configuration Files

Laravel has a lot of basic configuration in PHP files in the `/config` directory. In order to not overwrite these on an update, there is a way to override these in a `.env` file in the root of your phpVMS install that is generated by the installer. This contains information  such as the database, mail, and select configs from the `/config` directory. This file is used as an override (in the previous version of phpVMS, the `local.config.php` file is the same concept).

:::caution
Don't change the files in the `/config` directory; instead, edit the `.env` file instead. These won't be overwritten on an update.

See [Laravel configuration files](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/configuration) for additional documentation.
