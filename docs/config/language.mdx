# Change phpVMS Language

It is possible to change the system language from one of the available languages.

To do this, consult the directory `phpvms/resources/lang/` to see the name of the available ones.

Example: We want portuguese from brazil, We check that it is there `phpvms/resources/lang/pt-br`

Edit the `env.php` file with your desire language name, pt-br in our example.

```APP_LOCALE=pt-br```
