phpVMS provides an OAuth system that allows users to log in using social networks. Currently, only Discord is supported. Here is the information related to its configuration.

## Discord

First, you need to (create a developer application)[https://discord.com/developers/applications] on the Discord website. If you have already created this application to use the rich presence of vmsACARS, you can use the same one.

Next, go to OAuth2 > General. Copy the client ID and client secret to be used in the configuration later. Additionally, you need to add a redirect; the URL to add is `https://yourdomain.com/oauth/discord/callback`.

In the `.env` file, add the following:

```shell title=".env"
DISCORD_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID={your_client_id_copied_before}
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET={your_client_secret_copied_before}
```

Now, your users can link their Discord account to their phpVMS account and use their Discord account to log in. The link between the two accounts is automatically established when clicking the "Login with Discord" button on the login page. However, if the email address of the Discord account is different from the email address of the phpVMS account, it must be done manually on the profile page.

### Sending Private Messages

If you want to send private message notifications to your users (development still in progress), you need to create a Discord bot in the bot section of your Discord application and copy the token.

Place the token in the `.env`:

```shell title=".env"
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN={your_bot_token_copied_before}
```
