## Configuration Files

Laravel has a lot of basic configuration in PHP files in the `/config`
directory. In order to not overwrite these on an update, there is a way to
override these in a `.env` file in the root of your phpVMS install that is
generated by the installer. This contains information such as the database,
mail, and select configs from the `/config` directory. This file is used as an
override (in the previous version of phpVMS, the `local.config.php` file is the
same concept).

:::caution Don't change the files in the `/config` directory; instead, edit the
`.env` file. This file will not be overwritten on an update. :::

See [Laravel configuration files](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/configuration)
for additional documentation.
