## Configuration Files

Laravel has a lot of basic configuration in PHP files in the `/config` directory. In order to not overwrite these on an update, there is a way to override these in a `env.php` file in the root of your phpVMS install that is generated by the installer. This contains information  such as the database, mail, and select configs from the `/config` directory. This file is used as an override (in the previous version of phpVMS, the `local.config.php` file is the same concept).

:::caution
Don't change the files in the `/config` directory; instead, edit the `env.php` file. These won't be overwritten on an update.

See [Laravel configuration files](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/configuration#accessing-configuration-values) for additional documentation.

### Email

I recommend using a 3rd party service for sending email. They usually offer SMTP support, and great logging and analytics. Especially on a shared host, where email is locked down, and a "naughty neighbor" can quickly get the server/IP you're emailing from blacklisted.

The services I recommend and use:

* [Sparkpost](http://www.sparkpost.com) - Free up to 100k messages/month
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - Free, up to 10k messages/month


To configure email, in your `env.php` file, you need to configure the following options:

```php title="env.php"
MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_FROM_NAME='phpVMS No-Reply'
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS='no-reply@phpvms.net'
MAIL_HOST=
MAIL_PORT=
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=
MAIL_USERNAME=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
```

### Recaptcha

Recaptcha can be enabled, get the keys [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin). Then add/change the following to your `env.php` file. The section is there by default, just without the `sitekey` and `secret`.

```php title="env.php"
CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
CAPTCHA_SITEKEY='YOUR SITE KEY'
CAPTCHA_SECRET='YOUR SITE SECRET'
CAPTCHA_DATATHEME='light'
```
