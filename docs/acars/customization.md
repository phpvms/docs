## Logo Images

You can add your logo to the splash screen and the dashboard. They will be
resized down to fit. Fill in the URLs to your logos. They should be PNG format
(transparency is supported):

- **Splash Screen Banner** _Premium License Required_ - This replaces the large
  phpVMS splash screen. 500x375 recommended for best look, anything larger will
  be scaled down to the size.
- **Splash Screen Logo** - This adds a small logo to the bottom right of the
  splash screen. This can be combined with the splash screen banner. This will
  be sized to 150x150
- **Dashboard Logo** - This places a logo onto the dashboard, to the right of
  the user profile. This will be sized to 300x64 max.
- **Dashboard Logo Dark** - The logo to use for dark mode. If empty, it'll just
  use the Dashboard Logo

## Discord Rich Presence

:::tip This requires the ACARS Premium Addon :::

To customize the "Rich Presence" dialog in Discord, you need to create a new
Application in Discord. You'll then enter the provided `Application ID` into the
admin panel. If you don't set this, the default "vmsACARS" application will be
used.

![](img/discord.png)

#### 1. Create the Application

Visit
[Discord Application Developer site](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
and select "New Application". I suggest using your VA name, it will say
something like "Playing (whatever you enter)" (or something like "VA Name
ACARS")

Upload your logo and title it appropriately. **Make note of the "Application ID"
here, this will go into the admin panel.**

#### 2. Add your logos to the art assets

Next, go to "Rich Presence" and then "Art Assets". Add your cover image here,
and add a new **Rich Presence Asset** titled `logo`. This will be used in the
mini box that shows up

:::note

The logo asset added must be titled `logo`
