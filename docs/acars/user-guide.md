# Installation (Client)

---

## .NET 6.0 Runtime

If you don't have this installed, ACARS will prompt you to download it. But if
you want to download ahead of time, visit the
[Download Page from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime),
and select the x64 version for Desktop apps

![](img/runtime-path-dn6.png)

## ACARS Client

After downloading the zip, just extract the client into a folder (e.g, on your
desktop into a folder called `ACARS`). Then you can create a desktop shortcut
from the `acars.exe` for easier access.

:::caution vmsACARS files should NOT be placed in OneDrive synced
locations/folders, if you have OneDrive installed and enabled please use another
location other than your desktop or documents folders for acars extraction. :::

---

## Simulator Configuration

---

### FSX/Prepar3d Configuration

To use FSX/Prepar3d, you need to install:

- [FSUIPC](http://www.fsuipc.com) - the licensed version isn't required.
- [MakeRwys](http://fsuipc.simflight.com/beta/MakeRwys.zip)

After installing both, run `MakeRwys`. `MakeRwys` also needs to be re-run
whenever there are scenery changes (if you want gates/runways to be updated).

### X-Plane Configuration

X-Plane uses a custom plugin. Open the `X-Plane` folder, and copy the
`AcarsConnect` folder into your `Resources\plugins` folder.

![](img/plugin-copy.png)

Also it is possible to copy the plugin automatically from vmsAcars settings, be
sure X-Plane is not running and click the `Copy Plugin To X-Plane` button after
selecting your X-Plane root/main folder.

### MSFS Configuration

#### WASM Module

If you're using Microsoft Flight Simulator, to read the LVars from the sim you
need the `FSUIPC WASM Module (Version)` from [FSUIPC](https://www.fsuipc.com/) ,
`fsuipc-lvar-module` folder needs to be manually placed in your community
folder.

![](img/fsuipc_lvar.png)

Also it is possible to install the WASM Module with FSUIPC main installer. While
installing or updating it, be sure you have the WASM Module option enabled.

#### Scenery

:::caution Due to an MSFS limitation, sceneries purchased through the MSFS store
can't be scanned because they're encrypted. Only sceneries purchased outside of
the store and manually placed in the `Community` directory can be scanned :::

To use MSFS, select "Microsoft Flight Simulator" from the simulator list and you
will have two options:

    - "Native" - this will try to scan all of the scenery folders and BGL files.
    - "MakeRwys" - this will use the MakeRwys output (same as P3D). The files output by `MakeRwys` need to be placed in the root of the `Community` folder

#### Permission Denied Errors

If you're getting a permission denied error, see
[this thread](https://forum.navigraph.com/t/faq-navigraph-navdata-center-could-not-find-access-simulator/2104)

## Client Config

---

### Get the URL and API Key

You can either enter your URL and API key manually, or download the settings
config file from your phpVMS profile. To download the config file, visit your VA
and go to your profile:

![](img/profile-config-download.png)

And place it a folder called `My Documents/phpVMS`:

![](img/mydocs-settingsxml.png)

### Client Settings

After downloading the latest ACARS version, on startup, you'll be brought to the
configuration/settings page:

![](img/cli-setup.png)

### Sim Selection

After entering your URL and API key, select the simulator, and then select the
path to the simulator's root folder (for Fs9/FsX/Prepar3d or X-Plane)

:::info FSX/Prepar3d requires the `MakeRwys.exe` file, which can be downloaded
from the [FSUIPC Page](http://fsuipc.simflight.com/beta/MakeRwys.zip). It needs
to be placed in the same directory as FSX/Prepar3d, and it will create the
required files needed to scan. :::

After selecting the directory, click `Re-Scan Scenery`. This will load the
scenery database into ACARS for it to run/load later

---

### Mac/Linux Configuration

To run ACARS with X-Plane on the Mac or Linux, you have to run Windows in a VM.
On the Mac, I use [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html),
which is free for personal use. The procedure below will be similar for
Parallels or Virtual Box, which is roughly:

1. Add the X-Plane folder as a shared folder/mount to the Windows VM
1. Copy the `AcarsConnect` plugin to the `Resources\plugin` folder (see above)
1. Set the IP address in ACARS to the IP of the host

In order to get the scenery scanning working properly, add X-Plane as a shared
folder:

![](img/vmware-sharing.png)

Then click "Open In Guest", and you can follow the above instructions for then
installing the plugin. Then, in ACARS, properly set the "Scenery Path" and IP to
your Mac machine:

:::info If you configure it to point to the X-Plane root, the default share path
for VMWare Fusion would be `\\vmware-host\Shared Folders\X-Plane 11`. :::

![](img/vmware-acars-config.png)

Then you can launch/run ACARS as usual.

---

### Hardware Configuration

If you're using hardware to control the sim, ACARS heavily relies on several
offsets with FSUIPC, particularly the parking brake. Ensure that the offset
`0x0BC8` gets set

---

## Flight Planning

There are several ways to configure flight:

1. Enter everything manually
2. Load a flight from the flight search

### Entering everything manually

This is simple, just type in everything for your flight, referring to your VA
site.

### Flight Search or Bids

To load a flight from the search or bids, in the menu, select flight search. If
your VA has search enabled, you can click search. If you click on "Bids", it
will show your available bids.

If there is a SimBrief flight plan also loaded with the bid from the site, it
will show up as "Yes" in that column.

### Flight Plans

In order for the route map to show all of your waypoints, you need to load a
flight plan. vmsACARS does not have/contain any navigation information on its
own, it's all loaded from a loaded flight plan. The follow flight plan types are
supported:

1. FSX/P3D (`.pln`)
1. X-Plane (`.fms`)
1. MSFS (`.pln`)
1. Simbrief (`.xml`, exported from the SimBrief site or the SimBrief Downloader.
   There is a "phpVMS" flight plan type that's available)

The routes/navpoints are then loaded from the flight plan, along with the TOD
(from MSFS/Simbrief), and filed along with your PIREP.

## Lights and Aircraft Features

Lights and other features for aircraft may not work on all aircraft, due to the
way developers differently implement the on/off switches/flags for these (for
example, PMDG implements their lights differently for each aircraft). There is a
`ConfigMap.xml` file that can be edited (make sure to create backups before
updated - enhancements to this coming soon) which uses the aircraft name/title
to determine which offsets (for FSUIPC) or data refs (X-Plane) are used to
detect those features.

---

## Flight Phases

ACARS defines multiple flight phases, and the transitions between them are
detailed below. These rules are attemped to strike a balance between detecting
the phases properly for both IFR and VFR flights.

#### Boarding

- You must be on the ground to be able to start a flight. The parking brake
  should also be on

##### Notes

- The players starting position (gate, parking or runway) is attempted to be
  found. Otherwise, it's recorded as "Unknown"

#### Pushback

- Your aircraft has started moving, and is under 5kts
- If you started the flight with the brakes on and they are released

#### Notes

- The "Blocks Off" time is recorded
- For helicopters, this phase is recorded but is essentially bypassed once you
  leave the ground

#### Taxi Out

- The ground speed is above 5

#### Notes

- The "Taxi Out" timer is started
- For helicopters, this phase is recorded but is essentially bypassed once you
  leave the ground

#### Takeoff

- If you're detected to be on a runway, and your ground speed is over 30
- If you haven't been detected on a runway, your ground speed is over 80
  (rolling)
- You're no longer on the ground

##### Notes

- For helicopters, this phase is recorded but is essentially bypassed once you
  leave the ground

#### Enroute

- You're 500' AGL or above (to attempt to catch the earlier point) OR the gear
  are up (if they are retractable)
- More than 3 miles from the airport

#### Approach

- If you're at the TOD
  - If a flight plan is loaded and has a "TOD" waypoint (SimBrief, MSFS), that
    will be used
  - Otherwise, the TOD is calculated using
    [this method](https://www.flyingmag.com/technique/tip-week/calculating-top-descent/)
    (`TOD = (Plane Alt - Field Alt) / 3`)
- If you went above 10k' and are now below it

#### Final

- Below 3000' AGL
- Gear are down (if they are retractable)
- Flaps are down

#### Landing

- You're on the ground

##### Notes:

- The "End Flight" button shows up

#### Taxi In

- You're off of the runway and your ground speed is < 30

##### Notes

- The "End Flight" button shows up

#### Arrived

- The "End Flight" button must be clicked to set the flight to arrived
- Once "End Flight" is clicked, a button to file the PIREP will show

##### Notes

- The "End Flight" button shows up
- The parking/gate you're at will be attempted to be figured out

## Debugging

To debug whether the lights are working or not, you can open the "Debug" window.
To open it, go to the "Map" page, and double-click on "Flight Status". It will
open up the debug window, then you can scroll down to the lights, and see the
values for the lights being returned:
