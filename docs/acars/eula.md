expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement,
and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance,
usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company

exclusions and limitations set forth in this section 11 shall be applied to the
greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any warranty
exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be solely

any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has been
advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.
