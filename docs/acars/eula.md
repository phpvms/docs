affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether 
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of

rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case 
the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section 11 shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under 
applicable law. To the extent any warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be solely

out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or 
third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), 
even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy 
fails of its essential purpose.
